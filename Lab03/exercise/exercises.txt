Exercises 

	example 1

1.within the lab_b file memory is allocated using the p pointer. In addition to not being checked to make sure that it isn't null after malloc is called, memory from allocation 1 and 3 were never freed. 
2.As predicted in question 1 1071 blocks were allocated in memory. Of that 16 bytes were lost in block 1 of 2, and 19 in block 2 of 2
3.after adding the free and assigning NULL to p, o blocks were used and 4143 bytes were allocated, no memory lost.

	example 2 
1. the values at index 98 and 99 of the array are 84 and 96 respectively, they're not zero since we used malloc instead of calloc   
   in addition the arr pointer was never freed or assigned NULL at the end of the program. inaddition the i starts at 1 and it needs to start at 0 for indexing.

2. 400 bytes in memory was lost in 1 block out of the 1424 bytes allocated in the program, I freed the arr pointer and
   assigned it a NULL value before the program terminated.

3. after fixing the code 4496 bytes of code were allocated 0 blocks were lost and 0 bytes were lost.
