The purpose of this exercise was to understand how complex number 
work in c99. as a result functions were written that found both 
complex and real roots for 2nd order polynomials defined by the 
coefficients users type in the command line. 

In order to gain max performance from the program the Timing
macros from earlier labs e=were used to time the root finding
calculations, both per iteration and overall, using 100 
iterations as the repeat number. 

below you'll find the timing result at each possible 
optimization level. 

O0 output 
Elapsed CPU Time (rootTimer) = 8e-06 sec.
Elapsed CPU Time per Iteration (rootTimer, 100) =  8.00e-08 sec.
Initialization process beginning
The polynomial is fully initialized begin root...
root of: 1.000000x^2 + 0.000000x + 1.000000 is:
root 1: 0.000000 + 1.000000I
root 2: -0.000000 + -1.000000I

O1 output
Elapsed CPU Time (rootTimer) = 8e-06 sec.
Elapsed CPU Time per Iteration (rootTimer, 100) =  8.00e-08 sec.
Initialization process beginning
The polynomial is fully initialized begin root...
root of: 1.000000x^2 + 0.000000x + 1.000000 is:
root 1: 0.000000 + 1.000000I
root 2: -0.000000 + -1.000000I

O2 output
Elapsed CPU Time (rootTimer) = 7e-06 sec.
Elapsed CPU Time per Iteration (rootTimer, 100) =  7.00e-08 sec.
Initialization process beginning
The polynomial is fully initialized begin root...
root of: 1.000000x^2 + 0.000000x + 1.000000 is:
root 1: 0.000000 + 1.000000I
root 2: -0.000000 + -1.000000I

O3 output
Elapsed CPU Time (rootTimer) = 1e-05 sec.
Elapsed CPU Time per Iteration (rootTimer, 100) =  1.00e-07 sec.
Initialization process beginning
The polynomial is fully initialized begin root...
root of: 1.000000x^2 + 0.000000x + 1.000000 is:
root 1: 0.000000 + 1.000000I
root 2: -0.000000 + -1.000000I

As can be seen above optimization level 3 produces the 
best performance output per itertion for the complex 
root functions. This is what I expected and very much 
lines up with the timing outputs of my previous lab 
work where optimization 3 saw a significant decrease 
in execution time.
