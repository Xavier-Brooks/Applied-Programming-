running test 1
num1 is 0.000000, num2 is 0.000000, num3 is 1.000000
The polynomial is fully initialized begin root...
There is no solution a is 0

running test 2
num1 is 1.000000, num2 is 0.000000, num3 is nan

Elapsed CPU Time (rootTimer) = 7e-06 sec.
Elapsed CPU Time per Iteration (rootTimer, 100) =  7.00e-08 sec.
num1 is 1.000000, num2 is 0.000000, num3 is 1.000000
The polynomial is fully initialized begin root...
root of: 1.00x^2 + 0.00x + 1.00 is:
root 1: 0.00 + 1.00I
root 2: -0.00 + -1.00I
