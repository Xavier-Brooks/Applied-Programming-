Qn division 

8. The qnum =s are just integer according to the computer
   as a result you can just iteratively divide them by 
   the integer 2. 
   
10. users must use the fabs function in order to 
    print the absolute vlue of the floats correctly
    since the Qn numbers are just integers you can 
    use the normal abs function.  

Qn Multiply

4. Data loss occurred when converting back to a float 
   due to the right shifting of bits. thus some fraction
   bits are lost. 

Qn Complex equations 
9. The resulting value for the float operation was -674.933,
   -675 for the fractional calculation, and -674.932 for the
   fixed point calculations. 


Qn performance 
7. The fixed point operations were much faster at addition and
   multiplication than the floating point operations as they should
   be however at the ost of precicsion.
