using the nisection method from a previous lab I found
the root for the function to be .000101. The problem I'm 
having could not be solved with the help of multiple TAs.
for starters since the fixed format uses powers of two 
for fraction and the root solution is a fraction 
i solved the equation 2^x = .000101, what I found was
that the value x turned out to be 13.24....., meaning
the minimum nuber of bit was supposed to be 14 to hold
the fractional answer properly. I changed the number 
of fractional bits numerous times with 14, 12, 20, and 
32 as sizes but no avail. 

below you'll find the output of my code

Found the root 0.000000 using Qn 20 bisection.
Elapsed CPU Time (timer) = 2.6e-05 sec.
Elapsed CPU Time per Iteration (timer, 500) =  5.20e-08 sec.
Found the root 0.000101 using float bisection.

Elapsed CPU Time per Iteration (timer, 500) =  5.12e-07 sec.
Qn 20 error= 0.000001

my main focus was trying to get my ibisection to work but 
two entire days of debugging code that a TA stated was 
virtually identical was alot, I gave up lol. 

The lab asked to test for the optimization that 
gave the best resulting speed which I threw below.
Overall the optimization level 3 produced the

As can be seen above O3 ha sthe overall best performance 
thus I used it in my makefile when building the intTest
binary.

lastly a simple make file was created that builds the 
projects and test the program with timing enabled and 
without timing enabled for memory leakage.
