The task of this exercise was to use my knowledge of
pointers and implement a functions in LinkedList.c 
that adds nodes to a pre-existing list, remove nodes 
and initialze new lists. Overall I was unsuccessful in
completing the lab. The output for teh simpleTest bin
is almost close to the expected output from my understanding
however a solutions.txt file was never provided so I'm 
going based on my understanding of the simpleTest code.

Based on my output in out.txt I believe that my nodes are 
being added to the LinkedList correctly, however my removal 
of the front nodes isn't being handled correctly hence why 
the output in out.txt is wrong.

when I ran the mem binary I belive that the error was located 
in the remove front node function when I assign the "Previous"
pointer of the new front node to NULL. I missed office hours due
and exam unfortunately. In addition my understanding is that the 
nodes are being handled differently from the Semerar's book thus 
I was getting a little confused on that.
