Exercise 

step 8 

time ./lab_a 
Elapsed CPU Time (mainTimer) = 0.426108 sec.
Elapsed CPU Time per Iteration (mainTimer, 1000) =  4.20e-04 sec.

real   0m0.427s
user   0m0.427s
sys    0m0.000s

time ./lab_c
Elapsed CPU Time (mainTimer) = 3.40139 sec.
Elapsed CPU Time per Iteration (mainTimer, 1000) =  3.40e-03 sec.

real   0m3.403s
user   0m1.467s
sys    0m1.936s

from above you can see that the lab_a implementation of the 2d array
is much faster than the lab_c method. the lab_a model only needed 12% 
of the lab_c time to finish and overall the time linux binary reports 
virtually the same times as the macros that were used in the program 
itself. minor diferences are due to the time binary(linux) keeping track
of OS code execution as well as time for our lab binaries to actually start.
memory allocation also affects the time since lab_c allocates memory more.
