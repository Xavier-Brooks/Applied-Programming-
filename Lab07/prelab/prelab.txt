1. minimum requirement for root finding using bisection
 
2.the sign of the two bracket endpoints are opposite

3. The root found will never be zero but a potentially small 
number thats close to zero

4. Given two guesses calculate the midpoint and
pass into the function. based on the result readjust the
endpoints to close in on the root until 
endpoints have negative signs.

5. if the upper half of the interval bracket a
root then the midpoint becomes the lower endpoint
otherwise set it as the upper endpoint

6. The secant and newton methods are open methods that take an initial 
guess and will iteratively change the guess as it gets closer to the 
actual solution. 

7. The escape hatch is necessary so that the methods don't enter 
an infinite loop of trying to find the solution without stopping
and finding one.

8.The newton method requires the calculation of the derivative(slope) 
of the function when updating the guess.While the secant method only 
uses an approximation of the slope. 

9. 
newton
   Xnew = Xcurr - [f(Xcurr)/f'(Xcurr)]
secant 
   Xnew = Xcurr - f(Xcurr)[ (Xcurr - Xold) / (f(Xcurr) - f(Xold)) ] 

10.The second guess in the second method doesn't bracket the root
like that of the bisection method. 

11.fabs() returns the absolute of a double whereas abs() returns that 
of a integer
